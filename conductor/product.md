# Product Guide: Tiender

## 1. Initial Concept

Tiender is a mobile-first marketplace inspired by Tinder's swipe mechanic. Users browse products from various stores in a card-swiping interface. A right swipe indicates interest, and an explicit "Add to Cart" button places the item in a floating shopping cart.

The checkout process is handled off-platform. When a user decides to "place an order," the app generates a pre-filled WhatsApp message containing the order summary, which is sent directly to the store's WhatsApp number. This fosters a direct communication channel between the customer and the store.

## 2. Target Audience

### 2.1. Target Seller

Tiender is designed for small and medium-sized sellers in LATAM who currently operate through social media (WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook) and do not want or need a complex e-commerce solution. The platform is ideal for:

-   **Entrepreneurs and artisans:** Selling handmade goods, art, or niche items.
-   **Small local shops and boutiques:** Seeking a simple, low-cost digital sales channel.
-   **Digital-native D2C brands:** Looking for a new, personal customer discovery channel.

The typical seller manages their business from their phone, uses WhatsApp as their primary communication tool, has a small-to-medium catalog, and prefers customer proximity over mass-market traffic, avoiding transaction-based commissions.

### 2.2. Target Buyer

The primary benefit for the buyer is a fast, visual, and entertaining discovery experience ("digital window shopping"). It allows them to find unique products with zero friction and contact the store directly via WhatsApp to finalize the purchase or ask questions. The platform provides access to a curated catalog of emerging and local stores not typically found on large marketplaces.

## 3. Core Product Mechanics

### 3.1. Swipe and Cart Interaction

The user experience is centered around simplicity and clear intent:

-   **Right Swipe (Like):** This action signals user interest in a product. It is a metric for the store owner and can be used to influence product ranking and analytics. It does **not** add the product to the cart.
-   **Add to Cart Button:** Each product card features an explicit button to add the item to a floating, easily accessible shopping cart. This action requires clear user intent.
-   **No Wishlist:** To maintain simplicity and focus on conversion, a separate "Favorites" or "Wishlist" feature will not be implemented in the MVP.

### 3.2. Store Onboarding and Design

To ensure a high-quality, consistent user experience and minimize setup effort for the seller, Tiender provides:

-   **A Single, Optimized Template:** All storefronts will use a single, clean, modern, and mobile-optimized design.
-   **Automatic Personalization:** The template will automatically adapt to give a sense of brand identity by incorporating the store's logo and deriving a primary accent color from it. No advanced customization of fonts or layouts will be offered in the MVP.

## 4. Monetization and Subscription Plans

The model is a subscription service for stores, designed to be simple and scalable.

-   **Structure:** Plans are differentiated primarily by the number of allowed products and secondarily by the level of analytics provided.
-   **Core Features:** All essential functions (storefront, swipe discovery, cart, WhatsApp checkout) are available on all plans.
-   **Tiers (Example):**
    -   **Trial (Free):** 7-day trial with a limited number of products.
    -   **Basic:** Allows a higher number of products and includes basic analytics.
    -   **Pro:** Allows the largest number of products and unlocks advanced analytics, including natural language reports on metrics powered by AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash).
-   **MVP Scope:** Complex marketing tools and customer data export features are excluded from the initial version to keep the product lean and costs low.
