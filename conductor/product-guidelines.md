# Product Guidelines: Tiender

## 1. Brand Personality

**The Enthusiastic Connector:** Tiender's personality is that of an extroverted, sociable, and energetic friend. It's optimistic, enjoys connecting people with interesting products, and does so in a fun and motivating way. This personality is reflected in a user experience that is light, entertaining, and free of excessive formalities, inspiring curiosity and discovery, especially for mobile users in LATAM.

## 2. Voice and Tone

**Casual and Close:** The tone should always feel human, accessible, and friendly. Communication should be direct and inspiring, like a friend helping you discover something new. We must avoid technical jargon, corporate language, and overly aspirational phrases.

## 3. Visual Identity

**Clean, Vibrant, and Flexible:** The design system is built on three core principles:
-   **Minimalist Base:** The overall layout is clean and prioritizes white space to ensure the products are the main focus.
-   **Vibrant Accents:** Energetic and bold colors are used for calls-to-action, interactive elements, and branding moments, creating a dynamic feel.
-   **Dual Themes:** The interface supports both a light (default) and an elegant dark theme, allowing user choice and adapting to different environments.

## 4. UX Principles

**Radical Simplicity:** This is the most important principle guiding our user experience.
-   **Mantra:** If a feature requires an explanation, it is too complicated for the MVP. Every screen must be understandable in seconds without tutorials.
-   **Consequences:** Speed, fluidity, and consistency are natural outcomes of this unwavering focus on simplicity.

## 5. Communication with Sellers

**Actionable, Valuable, and Respectful:** All communication directed at store owners (notifications, emails, reports) must adhere to these rules:
-   **Purpose:** Every message must be valuable, helping the seller make a clear decision or understand their store's status.
-   **Delivery:** Communications will be grouped into periodic summaries (e.g., weekly) to minimize interruptions and respect the seller's time.
-   **Scope (MVP):** We will not use messages for artificial engagement. In the MVP, communication is strictly limited to metric reports, important subscription notices, and critical alerts.
